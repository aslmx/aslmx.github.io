# Aslmx 

Aslmx is a nerd that really seeks to improve his git skills by completing the MOOC: http://open.hpi.de/courses/git2020 Lets Git 2020!

He really enjoys this as the online practices with the bot are really nice to do. Really.

Looking forward for the next Pull Request :-)

And I really hope these were enough words for the Bot to consider this good haha...
